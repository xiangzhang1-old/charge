The crystallographic information files (CIFs) were extracted from Avogadro code (https://github.com/cryos/avogadro)
The correspoding structural files were generated by cif2cell code (http://sourceforge.net/projects/cif2cell/).

The naming rules of structural files: for example, GaSb_c(p)5.vasp  

c :: convetion cell
p :: primtive cell
5 :: POSCAR for vasp 5.x  

Check the generated structural file if necessary, particularly the symbol or/and the atomic number of each specie.
